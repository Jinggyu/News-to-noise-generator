# News-to-noise_generator
This is a real-time implementation simply transfers web contents (New York times articles) to spoken voice, and utilizes the generated speech creating a sound art piece. In this example, the generated speech are real-timely layered in orders (according to its posting time) and dissolved until the sound lost it's semantics.

## Built With
* [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) 
* Javascript

## Getting Started
The three js code functions seperatly:
* **speech.jsï¼š** transfer local .txt to audio files on your computer (check out the [applicable platform](https://github.com/Marak/say.js))
* **project.js:** &nbsp;&nbsp;is the main code that generates texts via API as well as does audio processing (sound composition) 
* **clear.js:** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;help to clear caches (if needed)

### Prerequisites
* To run speech.js, installing say.js and node.js. Follow the [instruction](https://github.com/Marak/say.js)
* Set the correct saving/reading directory 

### Installing
Run web.html using Local server. Here are two simple options:

**|Python 2|:**
